🎯 Overview

The Enhanced PDF Extractor represents a significant upgrade to the original extraction system, designed to maximize text extraction from Anderson's Library PDFs using advanced OCR and multiple extraction methods.

🚀 Key Improvements Over Original

Text Extraction Enhancements

✅ 15x More Text: Increased from 1,000 to 15,000 characters per field
✅ OCR Integration: Tesseract OCR for scanned/image-based PDFs
✅ Multiple Methods: PyMuPDF + PyPDF2 + PDFPlumber + OCR
✅ Enhanced Fields: Table of contents, abstracts, bibliography, tables
✅ Quality Scoring: Extraction quality assessment (0-100%)

Processing Capabilities

✅ Image Enhancement: OpenCV preprocessing for better OCR
✅ Extended Page Range: Process up to 10 pages vs. 4 previously
✅ Table Extraction: Structured table content capture
✅ Language Detection: Automatic text language identification
✅ Fallback Methods: Multiple extraction attempts per PDF

Performance & Reliability

✅ Error Recovery: Continue processing despite individual file errors
✅ Progress Tracking: Detailed progress with OCR/enhancement statistics
✅ Resumable: Pick up where previous extraction left off
✅ Memory Efficient: Optimized for large PDF collections

Enhanced CSV Fields

The enhanced extractor produces a CSV with expanded fields:

| Field Category | Fields | Description |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Basic Info | filename, filesizemb, pagecount | File metadata |
| PDF Metadata | pdftitle, pdfauthor, pdfsubject, etc. | Embedded PDF metadata |
| Extracted Data | extractedisbn, extractedyear, extracteddoi | Pattern-matched content |
| Text Content | firstpagetext, titlepagetext, copyrightpagetext | Page-specific text |
| Enhanced Content | tableofcontents, fulltextsample, tablescontent | Structured content |
| Processing Info | extractionmethod, ocrused, quality_score | Processing metadata |

Sample Output

🔍 Processing Methods

Extraction Pipeline

PyMuPDF (Primary): Fast, reliable text extraction
PyPDF2 (Fallback): Alternative parsing for problematic PDFs
PDFPlumber (Enhanced): Table and structure extraction
OCR (Image-based): Tesseract OCR for scanned documents

OCR Triggering

OCR is automatically triggered when:

Text extraction yields < 100 characters
PDF appears to be image-based
Manual OCR mode is enabled

Quality Assessment

Each extraction receives a quality score (0-100%) based on:

Metadata completeness (title, author, etc.)
Text extraction success
ISBN/DOI identification
Content structure detection
